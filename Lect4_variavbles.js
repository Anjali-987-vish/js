const a =133 //it is used to declare the constant values.
let b="anjalivishwakarmaanjali946@gmail.com"
var c="123"

console.log(a);

//console.log() is a tool in JavaScript that helps programmers check and track their code by printing messages to a special window called the console.

console.log([a,b,c,d]); //it is used to print the multiple values on console in the form of array

console.table([a,b,c,d]); //it prints the value in the form of table 

//var is older and has function scope, while let and const are newer and have block scope,

//prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope.
